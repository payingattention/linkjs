Agents

Thinking over a model for multiple clients in a shared operating environment. Particularly wondering how state should be indicated and tracked within the browser when the independent software unit is a widget within the page rather than an entire page. Put another way, if you have two widgets running at once, what should the URL bar say?

Currently, linkshui designates a primary widget to relate to the URL bar and lets the others just live as untracked UIs. It then assigns resources to all widgets for manipulation and access. This may be a successful model, but the question is interesting enough to explore more.

Agents are clients which navigate resource links and accumulate state. It might make sense to split the page into multiple agents which load the widgets, thereby separating the concept of the client (an agent) from the widget that currently populates it. The obvious choice would then be to give each agent a miniature URL bar to navigate with. With agent-names, a single CLI could direct the whole environment:

```
+i                          - create new agent named "i"
i:get #inbox [html]         - load the "inbox" app (widget) into it
i:get #usr/email [json]     - load email data
```

By loading an application, the agent takes on a behavior for interpreting responses. It knows to use the email response to populate itself because the inbox defines that handling.

Each agent could also serve resources which indicate aspects of its state (possibly an alternative to the URL bar).

```
j:get #doc/i/email [json] - pull out email data ("j" is another agent)
i:delete #doc/i/email     - drop the email data from the inbox
i:delete #doc/i/inbox     - drop the inbox behavior
doc:delete #doc/i         - remove the agent
```

It's interesting to consider the different kinds of behaviors that could load into an agent. For instance, perhaps you could build NPCs in a game, composing together multiple behaviors.

```
char:get #npc [app]       - load the "npc" app
char:get #npc/roam [feat] - load the "roaming" feature
char:get #beer [item]     - add "beer" to inventory
```

This is a pretty massive abuse of the content-type system (the words in the brackets) and, really, REST as it's known and loved, but I'm okay with that. This is hypothetical anyway.

The interactions are fairly lengthy in this situation, but it might be possible to bundle request sequences into browser-shell scripts and use them to compose programs. For instance, a script to start your webmail might be:

```
+wm                           - new agent
wm:get #inbox [html]          - load inbox app
wm:get #contacts [js]         - load contacts-manager tool
wm:get #config/webmail [json] - load default sources
wm:get #usr/facebook/messages - add facebook manually
```

Those scripts could define functions, for callability in the shell. `webmail()`

There would need to be an event system for handling responses. The default handler would load the response directly into the DOM. If that handler loads a widget, that widget could override the handling to decide how further responses are interpretted. That way, it opens itself to extension: running given callbacks, incorporating meaningful data, etc. 

Widget life-cycle would need to be managed by manipulating the resources. For instance, if a GET request delivers a widget that needs to take over the agent, that new widget would issue a DELETE command to the agent's "active software" link. 

Could be too much complexity for a relatively unimportant issue. Interesting to consider, though.

This comes down to two practical questions: the URL's ability to represent (and thus restore) state, and the configuration of behavior.

On the first item, it could be possible to concatenate all of the widgets' URIs into a string which would then restore the active widgets. That might be nice for loading up a page configuration with a copy & paste, but it depends on just how much state can be and needs to be implied.

On the second item, this environment is going to have to be configured by the user somehow (if for no other reason, to choose the remote services which populate the widgets). A simple choice is a config json, which is what linkshui currently does, and it could be a successful approach.

These ideas are an alternative which are meant to allow more dynamic behavior; rather than an on-load set of values, it uses an imperative list of requests which dictate the software and the data in the environment. The advantage would be that behavior could load in/out during runtime. The questions are, at least:

 - How successful would this system be? Would it work as expected?
 - How much power would a successful implementation of this system give? Would that power have a lot of practical use?
 - How much more complex would it be compared to onload config JSONs?
