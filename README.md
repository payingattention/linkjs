**Link has not yet had it's first official release, so you'll probably suffer if you try to run it. Packaging, documentation, and demos should be ready in 2 weeksish.**

Designed to help separate user interfaces from the web services they consume; enables users to customize, reuse, and independently evolve their interfaces and their services.
