Designed to help separate user interfaces from the web services they consume; enables users to customize, reuse, and independently evolve their interfaces and their services.

Browser JS apps are composed of client-side REST resources which may (or may not) poll remote servers for data, effectively behaving as proxies. This allows server-like decisions about response construction, but within the client, and with access to the client state. Additionally, client resources can attach rendering code to the response object, making it simple to handle content-types.
